# ZenjiCat – Vision

ZenjiCat is not just a meme.  
It’s a whisper on the Base chain – a gentle rebellion against noise, greed, and hype.

### 🧘 Core Ideas

- Calm is strength.
- Intention is louder than marketing.
- Building with care beats pumping with noise.

### 🌱 Manifesto

1. No VCs. No influencers. No noise.
2. Memes can be mindful.
3. Distribution should reward presence, not pressure.
4. Everything starts lo-fi and grows organically.
5. Zenji watches. Zenji remembers. Zenji vibes.

### 🛤️ Direction

ZenjiCat will:

- Emerge slowly through real participation  
- Use Zora, Farcaster & Base as its natural habitat  
- Be builder-native, mobile-first, human-aware  
- Stay weird, stay real, stay rug-free 🐾
