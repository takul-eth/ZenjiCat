# ğŸª¶ The Legend of ZenjiCat (Teaser)

> On the Base Chain, where markets roar and vanish overnight,  
> one cat remains â€” silent, patient, perfectly still.  
>
> While others chase candles, ZenjiCat brews digital tea,  
> waiting for the gas to cool before making a single move.  
>
> Some say it rests upon an ancient Ledger no one can open.  
> Others claim it hums softly when the chain is alive.  
>
> There are no promises of moonshots.  
> Only balance.  
>
> _Calm is the alpha._  
> _Onchain is the path._

ğŸ“œ _The full legend will be revealed in time._
